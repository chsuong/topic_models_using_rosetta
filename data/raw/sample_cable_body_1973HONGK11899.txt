SUMMARY:\nIN RECENT PERIODIC CONVERSATION WITH TREASURY REPRESENTATIVE\nCHEN HUNG, SUB-MANAGER BANK OF CHINA, MADE NUMBER OF COMMENTS\nON PRC'S WHEAT AND RICE TRADE, OIL EXPORTS, DESIRABILITY OF MFN\nFOR EXPORTS TO US AND PAYMENTS MECHANISM FOR SINO-US TRADE.\nEND SUMMARY\n1. CHINESE EXPORTS-CHEN MADE FOLLOWING REMARKS: (A) RICE\nEXPORTS ABOUT COVER WHEAT IMPORTS. (SINCE CONTEXT WAS MONETARY,\nTHIS IMPLIED THAT EARNINGS FROM RICE PAID FOR WHEAT IMPORTS.)\n(B) NEAR-TERMS PROSPECTS FOR EXPANSION OF OIL EXPORTS WERE\nSMALL AND REFERRED TO RECENT SALES TO HONG KONG AS NEGLIGIBLE;\n(C) MFN HAD IMPORTANT ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR PRC BECAUSE IT WAS\nIN COMPETITION ON MANY PRODUCTS WITH OTHER EXPORTERS WHO\nENJOYED IT. CHINA IN THIS SITUATION WOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT\nLOWER PRICE TO MAKE SALES; AND (D) MENTIONED INTEREST IN LIGHT\nINDUSTRIAL EXPORTS SUCH AS BICYCLES WHICH HE BELIEVED HAD BEEN\nSOLD TO US.\n2. SINO-US TRADE PAYMENTS -CHEN'S ACCOUNT OF PAYMENTS CONFORMS\nWITH OTHER INFORMATION. CHINESE IMPORTS ARE PAID FOR BY\nDEBITING PRC ACCOUNTS IN THIRD COUNTRY BANKS WITH BRANCES IN\nTHE US. CHINESE EXPORTS ARE PAID FOR BY LETTERS OF CREDIT OPENED\nIN THEIR FAVOR AND SENT TO PEKING, SHANGHAI OR OTHER DESTINATIONS\nWHICH ARE THEN COLLECTED BY BOC. THESE L/CS ARE NOT ALWAYS IN\nDOLLARS. AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD ADOPTED BY SOME BANKS IS TO\nOPEN RMB ACCOUNTS IN BOC WHICH WOULD THEN BE DEBITED TO PAY FOR\nCHINESE EXPORTS.\n3. CHEN EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN EFFECT OF OIL SHORTAGES ON\nUS, COUNTRIES TO WHICH US EXPORTED RICE, CURRENT US HARVESTS,\nAND OUTLOOK FOR HK ECONOMY NEXT YEAR.\n4. COMMENT: STATEMENT ABOUT WHEAT AND RICE SEEMS SIMILAR TO\nLI CH'IANG STATEMENT IN REFTEL. INFORMATION AVAILABLE HERE\nINDICATES THAT SUCH VOLUME RICE EXPORTS COULD ONLY BE POSSIBLE\nBY TRADE WITH COMMUNIST COUNTRIES WHERE FACTS ARE OBSCURE.\nWHILE PRC WOULD NOT RECEIVE HARD CURRENCY FROM EXPORTS TO\nCOMMUNIST TRADING PARTNERS, IT WOULD RECEIVE IMPORTS WHICH\nMIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE TO BE PAID FOR WITH HARD CURRENCY\nUNLESS RICE EXPORTS WERE PART OF CHINESE AID PROGRAM.\nOSBORN\n
