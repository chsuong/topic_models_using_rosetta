1. EMBOFF TODAY DISCUSSED MEXICAN PLANS FOR APRIL MEETING
ON UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS WITH AMBASSADOR ANTONIO GONZALEZ DE
LEON, NEW FONSEC DIRECTOR IN CHIEF FOR SPECIAL INTERNATIONAL
AFFAIRS AND STUDIES. AS WE HAD PREVIOUSLY LEARNED, GONZALEZ
CONFIRMED THAT UNDERSECRETARY CASTANEDA AND HE WERE TAKING
OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANT PROBLEM FROM
GALLASTEGUI AND AMBASSADOR CASTRO Y CASTRO RESPECTIVELY.
GONZALEZ SAID THAT HE EXPECTED TO ATTEND PLENARY MEETING IN
WASHINGTON FOLLOWING LOS NEGOATIONS IN NEW YORK AND TO
OUR SURPRISE HE ADDED THAT CASTANEDA WOULD CHAIR THE
EMXICAN DELEGATION TO THE MIGRANT MEETING.
2. GONZALEZ ASKED HOW WE VIEWED THE WASHINGTON MEETING AND
WHAT WE EXPECTED TO COME OUT OF IT, AND EMBOFF GAVE HIM NOW-
STANDARD LINE EMPHASIZING OUR HOPE THAT CONFRONTATION AND
POSTURING COULD BE AVOIDED. GONZALEZ SAID HE SHARED THIS
HOPE AND THOUGHT THAT PUBLIC RECRIMINATIONS COULD BE LEFT
TO EXCELSIOR AND INS OFFICIALS. NEVERTHELESS, HIS INITIAL
IMPRESSION OF THE PROBLEM WAS THAT IT HAD BEEN TREATED IN
THE PAST TOO MUCH AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER THAT COULD
SOMEHOW BE REGULATED OR MANIPULATED AWAY, RATHER THAN
AS A FUNCTION OF STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS BETWEEN OUR TWO
COUNTRIES WHICH WERE UNLILKELY TO DISAPPEAR OVERNIGHT.
EMBOFF SAID THERE WERE THOSE ON U.S. COMMISSION WHO AGREED
WITH THIS VIEW, THAT ESSENTIAL PROBLEM WAS IMBALANCE
BETWEEN BACKWARD MEXICAN COUNTRYSIDE AND ALLURING JOB
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE U.S. FOR THIS REASON, WE HOPED THAT
THIS FIRST MEETING OF COMMISSIONS COULD LAY GROUNDWORK FOR
EVENTUAL COLLABORATION TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS UNDERLYING
ILLEGAL MIGRATION--AND NOT SET A HABIT OF ANTAGONISM.
3. EMBOFF STRESSED THAT U.S. COMMISSION WOULD NOT GO
INTO MEETING WITH UNREALISTIC DEMANDS FOR MEXICAN ACTION
TO HALT FLOW OF ILLEGAL MIGRANTS. TO THE CONTRARY,
EMBOFF SAID HE EXPECTED U.S. SIDE TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON
"ACHIEVABLE"SHORT-TERM MEASURES AND PROJECTS WHICH BOTH
SIDES MIGHT VIEW AS BENEFICIAL TO THEIR INTERESTS, NON-
CONTROVERSIAL, AND HELPFUL IN ESTABLISHING A HABIT OF CO-
OPERATION. EXCHANGES OF DATA AND INFORMATION AND
COOPERATION IN DEALING WITH "COYOTES" WERE OFFERED AS POSSIBLE
EXAMPLES. CONZALEZ DE LEON SAID THAT THIS APPROACH HAD A
GREAT DEAL OF APPEAL FOR HIM, AND HE THOUGHT THAT
MEXICO WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS A LIMITED
PROGRAM OF TWO-WAY COOPERATION.
4. GONZALEZ SAID THAT HE AND CASTANEDA HAD ONLY BEGUN
TO DIG INTO THIS NEW AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DID NOT
YET HAVE A FEEL FOR VIEWS AMONG OTHER MEXICAN COMMISSION
MEMBERS. NEVERTHELESS, HE BELIVED IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
TO ACHIEVE A SPIRIT OF COLLABORATION AND AN ATMOSPHERE OF
INFORMALITY IF MEMBERS OF U.S. COMMISSION RECOGNIZE THAT
IMMIGRATION PROBLEM "CUT BOTH WAYS."
5. COMMENT: AS WITH FONSEC GARCIA ROBLES' COMMENTS TO
AMBASSADOR JOVA YESTERDAY (REFTEL), WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY
SIGNS THAT THE "NEW TEAM" AT FONSEC WANTS TO GET
COMMISSION DIALOGUE STARTED ON THE RIGHT FOOT. NEVERTHELESS,
REFERENCES TO THE NEED FOR A NEW LOOK AT"STRUCTURAL"
PROBLEMS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES HAVE NEGATIVE AS WELL
AS POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS, AND WE HOPE THEY DO NOT HERALD
THE INTRUSION OF NIEO RHETORIC INTO THE MIGRANT LABOR CONTEXT.
